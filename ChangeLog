wdns (0.5)

 * Update copyright and license statements as a result of the transition from
   Internet Systems Consortium to Farsight Security.

 * Escape literal backslashes when converting domain names or record data to
   presentation format.

 * Add a spec file for building on RPM systems, based on a spec file
   contributed by John Heidemann.

 * Replace the "librsf" submodule with the "libmy" subtree.

 * Correct the "Name:" field in the libwdns.pc file.

 * Make it possible to build with "make" rather than "gmake" on FreeBSD by
   generating libwdns.pc from the configure script rather than the Makefile.

 * Install the libwdns.pc file into the right directory on FreeBSD systems
   where pkg-config has been modified to read from a "libdata" directory.
